      <div id="reactions-intro">
        Oh wow! Chemical reactions!!!! This is one of my favorite topics in the entire chemistry unit, I'm so pumped!!!
        <br>
        <br>
        I really must do better in controlling my excitement, I sincerely apologize. When you are as passionate about science as Stephen Chakras, though, that is a difficult task. It matters not, though. What matters now is chemical reactions. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Now, when you picture chemical reactions, the first thing you think of is most likely massive explosions, or at least a little bit of smoke and fizz, or maybe potions bubbling and brewing like you see in cartoons. I assure you, most chemical reactions are much less severe than that; in fact, there's most likely been at least one chemical reaction that's happened around you today that you have not noticed. 
        <br>
        <br>
        There are a few different types of chemical equations that we will go over in this survival guide; the first being a synthesis reaction. 
        <br>

        Synthesis reactions are quite simple (and one of my favorite types of chemical reactions to work with). These chemical reactions are the combination of one or more smaller molecules or atoms into a larger molecule. The formula for this is quite simple: A + B --> AB, where A and B are atoms and/or molecules. 
        <br>

        <br>
        Sodium chloride, or table salt, is an example of a synthesis reaction; it is a product of the synthesis reaction between sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) - the resulting chemical, NaCl, or sodium chloride, is colloquially called table salt, and chances are, you've consumed that today, so congratulations! You've ingested science! That is one of Stephen Chakras' favorite passtimes.

        <h3>Decomposition Reactions</h3>

        <br>
        <br>
        Decomposition reactions are effectively the opposite of synthesis reactions - the general formula of a decomposition reaction is as follows: AB --> A + B. This is where a larger molecule will be split into smaller molecules or atoms, typically caused by electricity, heat or another catalyst.

        <h3>Single Displacement Reactions</h3>
        <br>
        <!-- MDL Progress Bar with Buffering -->
        <div id="p3" class="mdl-progress mdl-js-progress"></div>
        <script>
          document.querySelector('#p3').addEventListener('mdl-componentupgraded', function() {
            this.MaterialProgress.setProgress(0);
            this.MaterialProgress.setBuffer(100);
          });
        </script>
        <br>
        <br>
        Single displacement reactions are my favorite type of reactions. I, Stephen Chakras, refer to them as "single jealousy reactions" in my head; it helps me remember them better, and perhaps it will help you remember them too.
        <br>
        <br>
        The general formula for a single displacement reaction is as follows; A + BC --> AC + B. I call them single jealousy reactions because whenever I encounter these reaction types, I mentally envision the A element getting jealous of the relationship between B and C, and wishing they could be included. In this fictional storyline, A plots to separate B and C by getting really close to C, so that they will choose them over B, and eventually, C does, in fact, choose A over B, leading to A being accepted by C and B being rejected by C. 
        <br>
        I hope that explanation actually made sense and that it helped. I hope it wasn't just awkward rambling about fake relationships between literal molecules. 
        <br>
        <br>
        What is actually happening in this reaction is that Z is more reactive and bonds better with element B than element A does; element Z then displaces element A as a result, because element B faces a stronger attraction to element Z than element A. 
        <br>
        <br>
        A non-metal will displace a non-metal, a metal will displace a metal, and metals will react with acids and displace hydrogen (since they're both cations). 
        <br>

        You may be wondering, "Stephen Chakras, how do I know which elements are more or less reactive?! Am I meant to guess or base it on my personal opinion over which element could beat which in a fist fight?!". There is a very simple answer to this question; the activity series.
        <br>
        <br>
        The activity series is a calculated list of elements in order of most reactive to least; essentially, an element will displace all those beneath it, however cannot ususally displace those above it. This series works well as long as the reaction is taking place in a controlled, typical environment; there is no guarantees elements will behave as outlined in the activity series if the circumstances are unpredictable and uncontrolled.

        <h3>Double Displacement Reactions</h3>
        <br>
        <!-- MDL Progress Bar with Buffering -->
        <div id="p3" class="mdl-progress mdl-js-progress"></div>
        <script>
          document.querySelector('#p3').addEventListener('mdl-componentupgraded', function() {
            this.MaterialProgress.setProgress(0);
            this.MaterialProgress.setBuffer(100);
          });
        </script>
        <br>
        <br>
        Double displacement reactions are quite similar to single displacement reactions; the main difference is that there is two new compounds being formed by the displacement instead of just one. During a double displacement reaction, it usually seems like the elements are switching places. The general formula of a double displacement reaction is as follows; AB + CD --> AD + CB. It appears that A and C have simply swapped places. It is usually cations that swap places, so we can assume that A and C are cations in this reaction. 
        <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        There are two "special" kinds of double displacement reactions (these are simply just different classifications of double-displacement reactions). These special reactions are precipitaion and neutralization reactions. 
        <br>
        <br> 
        Precipitation reactions occur when two solution compounds react with each other to produce an insoluble solid, which is called a precipitate. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Neutralization reactions are seen more often in this course, and we will discuss them in the acids and bases section. Effectively, this occurs when an acid and a base react with each other and neutralize themselves; the product of this type of reaction is typically salt and water.

        <h3>Combustion Reactions</h3>
        <br>
        <!-- MDL Progress Bar with Buffering -->
        <div id="p3" class="mdl-progress mdl-js-progress"></div>
        <script>
          document.querySelector('#p3').addEventListener('mdl-componentupgraded', function() {
            this.MaterialProgress.setProgress(0);
            this.MaterialProgress.setBuffer(100);
          });
        </script>
        <br>
        <br>
        The last reaction type that I will discuss here is the combustion reaction; these occur when hydrocarbons are burnt. In this reaction, fuel burns or reacts very quickly and intensely with oxygen, which generally produces oxides and energy. The general equation for combustion reactions are as follows: A + O<sub>2</sub> --> AO + E, where A stands for an element, O<sub>2</sub> for oxygen, AO for an oxide and E for energy. 
        <br>
        <br>
        There are two different types of combustion reactions; complete and incomplete.
        <br>
        Complete combustion reactions are smoother, and they behave in practically a textbook manner. These occur when there is ample oxygen to be consumed by the combustion reaction. 
        <br>
        Incomplete combustion reactions are less sure and often more dangerous. These occur when there is not enough oxygen to completely carry out the reaction. In addition to producing the regular oxides and energy, carbon monoxide, which is an atypical oxide in this reaction type, not to mention dangerous to human life, and can cause unpredictable damage to the lab area.
