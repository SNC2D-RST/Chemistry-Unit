        I know what you must be thinking; "This is the very first thing we learn in the course! It is introductory level material, how could it be so intensely important!" I assure you, dear user, that it is perhaps the most important element in this guide, and thereby the course. This may sound daunting, but have no fear; Stephen Chakras is here to keep you safe. 
        <br>
        <br>
        As this is a survival guide, I must naturally include the one topic that will affect your survival; lab safety and proper use of equipment. It is imperative to learn how to use and work with the equipment in order to survive and thrive in this course. Below you will find the basic information about lab safety, equipment and HHPS & WHMIS symbols.

        Beginning with the lab equipment, here is a list of all of the equipment, along with a labelled image and description, of the equipment you are most likely to encounter in the lab.
        <br>
    </center>
      <ol>
        <li>Goggles (This protects your eyes)</li>
        <li>Beaker (This is a container which is used to store, heat or transport substances)</li>
        <li>Scale (Also referred to as Triple Beam Balance, this is used to measure the mass of a substance or object)</li>
        <li>Test Tube (This is used to observe reactions or heat chemicals. The tube is usually quite small)</li>
        <li>Beaker Tongs (This is used to pick up objects, particularly beakers)</li>
        <li>Apron / Lab Coat (This protects yourself and your clothing from dangerous chemicals)</li>
        <li>Flint Spark Lighter (This is used to light a Bunsen burner)</li>
        <li>Ring Clamp (This attaches to a lab stand and it is used to hold a wide variety of other lab equipment in place safely)</li>
        <li>Eye Dropper (This is used to dispense a very small amount of liquid. In this course, is not meant to dispense the liquid into a living being's eye, despite what the name may suggest)</li>
        <li>Graduated Cylinder (This is used to take precise measurements of volume)</li>
        <li>Lab Stand (This is used alongside a ring clamp; it is once again used to hold a wide variety of lab equipment)</li>
        <li>Bunsen Burner (This is used to heat chemicals and objects. Do not touch the surface)</li>
        <li>Funnel (This is used to hold filter paper and pour substances into small-mouthed containers safely)</li>
        <li>Erlenmeyer Flask (This is a narrow mouthed container which can be used to transport, store or heat various chemicals and substances. It is often used in conjunction with a stopper)</li>
      </ol>

        It is very important to know the equipment which you will be using and how to use it safely, however, lab safety is not limited to proper care and use of the instruments. Lab safety is also knowledge of chemicals and their respective dangers.
        <br>
        <br>
        WHMIS (Workplace Hazardous Material Information System) and HHPS (Hazardous Household Products System) symbols inform the user the dangers of the products they are using through simple symbols and icons.
        <br>
        <br>
        This is extremely important, as if there is a spill or a reaction, you need to be able to quickly identify if the chemical is corrosive, poisonous, flammable or if it possesses any other dangerous property so that you can act accordingly.
        <br>
        <br>
        Here are some posters to help you understand WHMIS and HHPS symbols.
