        Subatomic particles are, as the name implies, smaller than atoms. There are three subatomic particles which I will discuss in this guide; protons, electrons and neutrons.
        <br>
        <br>
        Protons are positively charged subatomic particles. The number of protons is essentially what determines what the element is; if there are 6 protons, for example, then we know the element is carbon, as the atomic number of carbon is 6, and the number of protons inside of the atom of an element is equal to the atomic number of the element. Electrons are negatively charged subatomic particles. If the atom and element is not negatively charged, then the number of electrons inside of that element will also be equivalent to the atomic number of the element. Neutrons are neutrally charged subatomic particles. The number of neutrons in an atom is equal to the difference between the mass and the atomic number. To simplify, subtract the number of protons from the atomic mass of the element; the resulting number is the number of neutrons in an element!
        <br>
        <br>
        Protons and neutrons are found inside of the nucleus, while electrons exist outside of the nucleus, but still part of the element.
        <br>
        <br> 
        To represent the subatomic particles in an element, we use a method called Standard Atomic Notation. There are three key points to include in atomic notation, which is the mass number, the atomic number, and the chemical symbol of the element. Here is an image from the 1.1 Atoms Review note to illustrate Standard Atomic Notation:

      <h3>Periodic Table of Elements</h3>

        Now, you may be wondering, "Stephen Chakras, you've mentioned all of this information about the atomic mass and the atomic number, but where do you find that information?" The answer is quite simple; the periodic table. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The periodic table of elements contains all of the known, observed and confirmed elements in the universe. There are over 100 of them. The periodic table is arranged by the atomic number of the element and separated into three distinct groups; metals, non-metals and metalloids. The following table is from the 1.3 Periodic Table note, and it describes various properties of metals, metalloids and non-metals.
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="/images/metal-classification-table.png" alt="the table which defines the characteristics of metals, non-metals and metalloids">
        <br>
        <br>
        Another way we organize the periodic table is through periods and groups. Periods are horizontal segments of the table, and there are seven of them. It is helpful to organize the periodic table into periods as each element in a single period has the same number of eletron shells. Groups, which are also occasionally called families, are the vertical columns of elements on the periodic table. There are 18 in total. It is helpful to organize the periodic table into groups because each element in a single group has the same number of valence electrons (which is the number of electrons on the outermost electron shell of an atom). Because they have the same number of valence electrons, they will behave and react similarly, only with varying intensity.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are four main groups that you should endeavour to memorize (these will most likely be on the test, as they were for my class): 
        <ul>
          <li>Alkali Metals (Group 1 on the periodic table) - these are shiny, soft and generally silvery metals. They are incredibly reactive.</li>
          <li>Alkaline Earth Metals (Group 2 on the periodic table) - these metals are still shiny and generally silvery, however they are not as soft as alkali metals. They are not as reactive as alkali metals either, but they are still more reactive than most other elements. </li>
          <li>Halogens (Group 17 on the periodic table) - found on the right side of the periodic table, these are the most reactive non-metals.</li>
          <li>Noble Gases (Group 18 on the periodic table) - These elements are very unreactive. They are found on the very far right, they are all gases at room temperature (as the name implies) and they are all colorless, odorless and tasteless. </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        I know this must all sound confusing, but stay with me, dear user. I know it's a lot of information, but we're getting there. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Reactions between elements occur because all elements want a filled valence shell through gaining or losing electrons. Metal elements are more reactive the further down and to the left you travel across the periodic table. Non-metal elements are more reactive the higher and further to the right you travel across the periodic table. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This may be difficult to remember, but there is a logical explanation to this. As we know, the group number correlates directly to the number of valence electrons in an element. Atoms are more reactive depending on what's 'easiest' to do; for instance, it's easier to lose one electron instead of two, so metallic elements further to the left will not have to work as hard to get a full valence shell and therefore will be more reactive. The same applies for moving down; it is easier to lose an electron in the 3rd shell than it is to lose an electron in the 1st or 2nd shell; this is because the electrons in the outermost shells are not held as tightly as the electrons in the inner shells. 
        <br>
        <br>
        An atom which loses an electron will then have a positive charge. It is shedding the negative and thus there will be more protons than electrons, so the element will be more positive, as we know electrons carry a negative charge and protons carry a positive charge. An atom which gains an electron will then have a negative charge. It is gaining an electron so thus there will be more electrons than protons so the cahrge will be negative.

        Now, we know all of this information about valence electrons, but how can we represent this information? Well, this is where Stephen Chakras' favorite element of chemistry comes in; we can use Bohr Rutherford and Electron Dot diagrams. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This section combines two of my favorite things; science and art. Bohr Rutherford and Electron Dot diagrams are diagrams that illustrate the configuration of the atom, and particularly these two both notably highlight the electrons in an atom of an element.
        <br>
        <br>
        Before we begin, it's important to know the fundamental rule of electrons. Electrons are not found inside of the nucleus, but rather they orbit around the atom. As such, they are arranged into shells, which have limits to the number of electrons they can hold. The first shell can hold 2 electrons, and the second and third can hold 8 each.
        <br>
        <br>
        Now that the matter of electron shells has been sorted, we will start first with Bohr Rutherford diagrams; these are more detailed than Electron Dot diagrams, but fret not, as they are still quite simple. To write a stunning Bohr Rutherford diagram, follow these rules.
        <br>
        <br>
        First, draw a circle to represent the nucleus; it should be big enough to hold some words, but small enough that you will have enough space to write and draw more elements around the circle. 
        <br>
        Next, write the number of protons (i.e 12p) and the number of neutrons (i.e 12n).
        <br>
        After, draw a wider circle around the first circle that represents the nucleus; this circle represents the first electron shell. Draw some small cirlces/dots to represent the number of electrons in the shell. Add more shells as necessary; remember that there are limits to how many each can hold.
        <br>
