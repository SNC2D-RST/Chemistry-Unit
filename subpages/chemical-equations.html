      <h1>Clever Chemical Equations!!</h1>

      <div id="chemical-equations-intro">
        If you are struggling with chemical equations, please do not feel distressed: you are not alone. Chemical equations are, in my opinion, one of the most difficult things in this unit. It is quite complex and there are many rules involved. 
        <br>
        <br>
        For the sake of readability and comprehension, I will simply link as many resources as I can find all about chemical equations rather than try to verbally explain it in my own words; though I understand the concept well enough, I fret that I may create confusion in my explanations. 
        <br>
        <br>
        First and foremost, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yAjOza0xs34jnb_qx-jR9G0sUMjuExxydkh9HQt-nDA/edit">here</a> is the class note that describes chemical equations, including the various rules and nuances to the topic, and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iD7WS2_2nXlyOocElVXJRnBaPvsyaiok/view">here</a> is the answers to the questions we had done. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I include the answers to the questions so that you may see examples of the type of questions asked concerning chemical equations, and also so that you can see how to properly answer these questions. In reading the answers, you can see how the answer was derived, what process was undertaken to achieve these results, how to properly format your response, and to clarify if you were struggling with your own work. 
        <br>

        Balancing chemical equations can be difficult to learn and seem incredibly daunting and confusing, but I swear to you on my honour as Stephen Chakras, once you become comfortable with them, balancing them becomes almost routine; you will be astonished by the ease of which you will be able to balance the equations with sufficient practice. It's worth it, I promise.
