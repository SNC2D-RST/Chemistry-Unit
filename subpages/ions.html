        Ah yes, ions! Beautiful things, but not as beautiful as my beloved atoms. It is of no difference, though. Ions are fundamental nonetheless, and on this page you will find a vast amount of incredibly important information about the incredibly iconic ions that exist in our world.
        <br>
        <br>
        To put it simply, an ion is an atom that has been charged - be it positively or negatively - by the loss or gain of electrons. There are two main different types of ions; cations and anions.

        Cations and Anions sound quite complicated, but I assure you, on my honour as Stephen Chakras, that they are in fact quite simple. 
        <br>

        <br>
        <br> 
        Cations are positive ions. In general, it is metals who will lose electrons to form a cation (remember, the more negative electrons that an atom loses, the more positive it becomes, as there will be more protons than electrons). The name of a cation (positive ion) is the same as the name of the element (i.e barium becomes barium ion). 
        <br>
        <br>
        Anions, as you may have guessed, are negatively charged atoms. It is typically non-metals which will gain electrons and make anions (there are more negative electrons than there are positive protons, so the charge is negative). The naming method of anions differ slightly, in order to be able to differentiate between cations and anions quickly. The name of an anion will be the stem name of the element with "-ide" added (i.e oxygen become oxide, meaning OX is the stem).

        I seem to have gotten too excited again - I apologize. I am in possession of some very strong opinions concerning science, and occasionally these opinions manifest as very passionate dialogue. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Regardless of my scientific opinions and beliefs, we are here to discuss polyatomic ions. These ions are made up of one atom, although they behave and function as a single particle. There are many different polyatomic ions. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I wish I could tell you there was a trick to remembering polyatomic ions, but I've never discovered any that have actually worked for me. I just ended up familiarizing myself with the formulas and names enough that I could recall them in the context of a question on a test or worksheet.
        <br>
        <br>
        Although I have already placed an image with the formulas and names of the most common polyatomic ions above, it never hurts to have more resources in your toolbox, so here are a few more images with the names of the most common polyatomic ions and their recipes.

        Have you developed a headache from all of the information you are digesting? Are you feeling stressed and worried about your lack of knowledge of polyatomic ions? Are you an enjoyer of word searches?
        <br>
        <br>
        If you have answered yes to any of these questions, I would highly recommend this very beautiful word search that I politely took from a google search! Not only does it contain polyatomic ion names, but it is also a fun destressing activity! Perfect!
