      <div id="compounds-intro">
        The long awaited compounds and bonds section! Rejoice, for it is finally upon us. 
        <br>
        <br>
        There are many different kinds of compounds and bonds in chemistry, though in this section we will be focusing on the 3 main types found in this course; ionic compounds, polyatomic ionic compounds and molecular/covalent bonds. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Now, you may be asking: "Stephen Chakras, what is a compound? What does it mean if something is a compound?" Fret not, for I will explain it to you.
        <br>
        A compound is two or more atoms that have become chemically bonded; essentially, they are atoms that have become chemically attached to form one compound being.

      <div id="covalent-bonds">
        Covalent bonds! They are all around us. A covalent bond is also often called a molecular bond, and it typically occurs between two non-metals. A covalent bond is when two or more atoms "share" electrons to fill their valence shells. Neither atom has enough of a pull to completely take the electrons, so they end up bonded over the electron. To illustrate, here's an image of a covalent bond between two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom:
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="/images/covalent-bond-example.png" alt="A covalent bond between two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom">
        <br>
        <br>
        In a covalent bond, there is no permanent exchange of electrons happening, no anions or cations being formed; only the mutal agreement between two or more atoms to share their electrons so they can all have a full valence shell and be satisfied. Did you know that the majority of known compounds are molecular? Isn't that fascinating?!
        <br>
        <br>
        To represent a covalent bond, draw the Bohr Rutherford or Electron Dot diagrams of the atoms and elements involved in close proximity to each other, and use an arrow or an x to symbolize the electron being shared. 
        <br>
        <br>
        A very important element in molecular bonds is diatomic elements. These are the same atom, except twice. The most common elements can be easily remembered through the acronym HOFBrINCl (Hydrogen, Oxygen, Fluorine, Bromine, Iodine, Nitrogen and Chlorine).

      <div id="ionic-bonds">
        Ionic bonds are my favorite kind of bonds! I think they're pretty cool. 
        <br>
        Ionic bonds occur when two or more atoms give up or take electrons to fill their own valence shells. For example, in a scenario where there are two chlorine atoms and one magnesium atom, magnesium will lose two electrons, one going to each chlorine atom; this leaves us with magnesium ions and chloride ions (magnesium ions holding a charge of +2 and each chlorine atom carrying a charge of -1 respectively). This creates an attraction between the two oppositely charged ions, which is what keeps the bond intact. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Ionic bonds occur between a metal and a non-metal. It is typically the metal which will form a cation and the non-metal which will form an anion; as mentioned earlier in this unit review, it is easier to lose two electrons than to gain 6, just as it is easier to gain one electron than it is to lose 7. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Here is an image of an ionic bond:
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="/images/ionic-compound-example.png" alt="an image of an ionic bond between one magnesium atom and two chlorine atoms">
        <br>
        <br>
        To represent an ionic bond in writing as a formula, there are two methods taught in the course that are quite simple and effective. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The first is the zero-sum rule: essentially, you must write the symbols of the elements bonded, then their respective ionic charges above the symbol, and determine how many ions are required of each type to make the sum equal zero. The ions required (the coefficients) are written as a subscript in front of the chemical symbol of the atom, unless the coefficient is 1 (in this case, just leave it blank). Simplify it to the lowest ratio (i.e coefficients of 2 and 4 are reduced to 1 and 2, as that is an equivalent ratio) and you're done!
        <br>
        Here's an image from the lesson to better illustrate the zero-sum rule for the visual learners using this guide:
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="/images/zero-sum-rule.png" alt="a screenshot from lesson 6, 5.7, ionic and covalent bonds, particularly of the section detailing the zero sum rule.">
        <br>
        <br>
        The next is the criss-cross method (this one is my personal favorite, and also much simpler in my opinion!); start by writing the chemical symbol and the charge of the atom Then, you will crisscross the charges, so that the charge on the right atom then becomes the subscript on the left element and vice versa. Like the zero-sum rule, do not write 1 as an element's subscript, just leave it blank. Simplify to the lowest ratio, and that's all!
        <br>
        <br>
        Here is an image of the criss-cross method:
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="/images/criss-cross-method.png">
        <br>
        <br>
        The subscript of these chemical symbols indicate how many of each atom is used inside of the formula; for instance, in the example above, there would be one magnesium atom required and two chlorine atoms, since there is a subscript of two on the chlorine symbol. 
        <br>
        In chemistry, we use the subscript because it is neater looking and easier than writing the chemical symbol twice.

        Ionic polyatomic bonds are quite similar to normal ionic bonds, except using polyatomic ions. The polyatomic compound behaves as a single atom, even though it is not. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The formula can be determined in the same way as normal ionic compounds; here is an example of determining the formula of a polyatomic ionic compound using the criss-cross method:

        The rules concerning the naming of a covalent compound is quite simple; the majority of changes comes from prefixes. Prefixes are used in accordance to the quantity of an atom used in the formula; for example, if there are three chlorine atoms, it would be written as "trichlorine". The subscripts become the prefixes. The only exception to this rule is if there is only one of the first element, then you would not use the "mono" prefix. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Here is a list of the prefixes used:
