        Stephen Chakras is a firm believer in the idea that education should be fun! Activities like Kahoot, Quizlet, Blooket and Quizziz are not only fun but also aide in the learning process! If you're looking for a more relaxed way to study without having to memorize every single word on your notes paper, then these applications can certainly help with that!
